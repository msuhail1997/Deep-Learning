#Classification of Tumours in Breast Cancer Diagnostic Wisconsin dataset using PyTorch and SKLearn

Training and Testing were done on Breast Cancer Diagnostic Wisconsin dataset to obtain classification of tumours to Benign and Malignant based on 10 features.
-Hyperparamaters tuning, Normalization of features and Cross Validation were implemented for the 5 ML models created.
-The following Test,Train accuracies for each of the models were obtained.
